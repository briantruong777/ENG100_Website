    <p>My name is Brian Truong and I am a student at the University of Illinois majoring in Computer Science. I've always liked computers (and video games), but only after being programming leader on my school's robotics team, have I realized that I want to pursue a career in software.</p>
		<p>Anything technology or engineering interests me, but software development especially attracts my curiosity. I like the idea of carefully crafting a system that can handle immense amounts input and create something useful or beautiful. I like that idea even more when other people are involved because working with people increases the fun.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in a more detailed and organized format of what I've done, here's my <a href="assets/Resume_Brian_Truong.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a>. You should also visit the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> section of my website.</p>
