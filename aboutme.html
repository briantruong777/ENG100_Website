		<p>My name is Brian Truong and this is a placeholder. I'm not really sure what I should write here yet, but probably something far more serious than this. Maybe I'll mention my hometown, Naperville, IL, and that I am currently studying at UIUC to major in computer science. I've always liked computers (and video games), but only recently, after my experience on my school's robotics team, have I realized that I like working on a team on some software project. This led me to majoring in computer science to learn more about software engineering.</p>

		<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume-FirstnameLastname.pdf">résumé</a> that currently has nothing in it.</p>
