		<p>My name is Brian Truong and this is a placeholder. I'm not really sure what I should write here yet, but probably something far more serious than this. Maybe I'll mention my hometown, Naperville, IL, and that I am currently studying at UIUC to major in computer science. I've always liked computers (and video games), but only recently, after my experience on my school's robotics team, have I realized that I like working on a team on some software project. This led me to majoring in computer science to learn more about software engineering.</p>
		<p>I guess there should be some pictures here or something.</p>

		<p>There we go. I'm totally not playing touhou or anything like that. This is an intense programming session during robotics season with the rest of my team.</p>

		<p>Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume_Brian_Truong.pdf">résumé</a> <del>that currently has nothing in it.</del> that now has something in it.</p>
