		<h3>This Website</h3>
    <p>This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I learned basic web development by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through FTP. I also implemented my own novel feature to the website, but it's a secret.<br/><br/>
Okay, not really, but if you somehow still haven't found it, just spend some time clicking around on the main page (I mean that literally). The idea originates from a program I made in TI Basic during Stats class. Of course, this version runs a million times better. I also used Google Fonts (Roboto specifically) and used javascript for the link animations and the page transitions.</p>

    <h3>Mendelbrot Set Android App</h3>
    <p>Started at the ACM Hackathon, it can currently actually display one step of the set. Immedietely afterwards, it crashes. Obviously still needs work.</p>

    <h3>Volume Android App</h3>
    <p>An old relic of my highschool life. I designed an Android app to control certain volumes since my Droid X wouldn't let me change them normally. This has evolved into a customizable app that can adapt to any Android device. I still plan on doing more work on this, but the project is on hiatus for now.</p>
