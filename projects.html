		<h3>This Website</h3>
		<p>This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I learned basic web development by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, <del>and managed my website hosting through FTP.</del> (Nope, too lazy and doesn't seem necessary. Maybe later.) <del>I also implemented my own novel feature to the website by adding write about it here</del> (Nope, haven't done this yet either).</p>.
